                        <strong>Online Dashboard</strong>: Manage your group health benefits from a simplified online
                        dashboard with real-time data updates, increasing accuracy and reducing the potential for

                    <p>
                        <strong>Enrollment Management</strong>: The days of paper applications are over! Our technology
                        eliminates paper forms, provides real-time updates as your employees advance through open
                        enrollment and sends employee plan selections directly to your carrier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Deduction Management</strong>: We facilitate your employees health insurance deductions
                        for you. Changes you make will automatically flow between systems, including all employee
                        demographic data and payroll deductions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Online Enrollment</strong>: Your employees will receive email reminders when it’s time
                        to enroll. They can complete the entire process and submit their plan selections online —when
                        and where it's convenient for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Plan Comparison</strong>: Your employees will benefit by viewing side-by-side plan
                        comparisons with coverage and cost details. This allows your employees to make better decisions,
                        while helping to reduce uncertainty and questions during the process.
