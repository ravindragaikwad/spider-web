                        Quick and improved releases are the need of the hour in today’s software development landscape.
                        This calls for the immediate identification, correction, and updating of software products. The
                        DevOps model brings the development and operations teams together, in order to improve the speed
                        and quality of the products delivered to customers.

                    <p>
                        DevOps is now capturing the market share of enterprises, which need to ensure the quality
                        products reaching the end user before the competitor does. At this stage, it is important to
                        understand what hinders the project team from delivering the product in time. For this,
                        enterprises need concerted efforts to manage team and resources with the help of agile tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enterprises don't want to compromise on seizing the market opportunities. For that, an approach
                        is required where communication, collaboration, and integration between software developers and
                        IT operations teams effectuate wonders in project management. In order to thrive the enterprise
                        field, a DevOps approach is essential for a swifter and secure way to work cohesively and
                        release the product. Small and medium enterprises that are aspiring for growth and want to be in
                        growth mode can consider DevOps approach for agility and efficiency.

                    <h4>Our Agile practices:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Agile development practices at Keva Systems LLC can help development teams to generate quality
                        builds faster. But this does not mean that operations team can keep the pace with the
                        development team as they may find it difficult to catch up in the absence of the right tools.
                        Often what happens in IT teams is, operations team pitted against the development team, working
                        in silos resulting in the slow progress of product delivery. To be specific, operations teams
                        want to avoid the risks that come with changes made to applications and infrastructure like
                        breaching SLAs, system downtime, and outages. This makes them view new software releases with
                        concern. As a result, delays in new software releases to the market.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Our Way of Approach in DevOps:</h4>
                    <p>
                        We at Keva Systems LLC ensure faster product delivery dev and ops team need to focus on
                        collaboration, automation, and monitoring, involving the key stakeholders’ business, apps, and
                        ops. Our technical team can improve their agility is by going for an “inspect and adapt”
                        approach using tools that provide end-to-end visibility. With this, they can track application
                        development, QA, and production from a central hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coupled with this we can monitor how applications, configurations, and environments view changes
                        and respond to it appropriately. With the help of customized templates, teams can ensure
                        continuous integration and delivery.

                    <p>
                        In each of the stages development, various tools are used for automation. For example, a tool
                        like Box up provides a unified interface to the developers to manage development environments
                        efficiently. This also helps to concentrate on coding instead of putting infrastructures in
                        place. The above listed DevOps tools aid in simplifying the complex process of coordinating and
                        integrating the functions of two teams. Today many open source DevOps tools are now available in

                        deployment of products. Other DevOps tools like Vagrant, Puppet, and Docker are used for
                        continuous deployment. Vagrant environments made easy with features that include:
